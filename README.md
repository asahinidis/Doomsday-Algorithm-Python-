# Doomsday-Algorithm-Python-
For fun I created a short ~125 line script (written in Python) to display the day of the week for any date Anno Domini (AD). The Doomsday Algorithm was implemented to do achieve this feat.

To run,

1) Open your terminal / command prompt.
2) Go to your directory which includes doomsday.py.
3) Enter `python doomsday.py *NUMERICAL MONTH* *NUMERICAL DAY* *NUMERICAL YEAR*`.
